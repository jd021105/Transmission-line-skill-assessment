🌌 Real-World Applications of TM and TE Waves Between Parallel Plates
1. Microwave Waveguides in Radar & Communication Systems
📡 Application:
Parallel plate waveguides that support TE and TM modes are used in radar systems and satellite communication to guide microwaves efficiently with minimal loss.

🛠️ How It Works:
TE and TM modes define how the electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields are distributed between the plates.

These waveguides carry signals in systems like space-borne radar antennas, including those on deep space probes like Voyager 1.
